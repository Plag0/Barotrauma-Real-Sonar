## Sonar can now kill you.
Based on real-life military submarine sonar, this mod overhauls the in-game sonar system to make it more dangerous and challenging to manage.

**Crewmates** - will need to be more aware of their surroundings, stay away from hull breaches while the sonar is active, and be careful of the deadly echo chambers known as ballast tanks.
**Captains** - will have to be extremely careful with their use of active sonar, be aware of crew positions, and communicate when it's safe to do repairs.

Sonar can be used to fight off creatures, but it can also draw the attention of more and cause serious injury to the crew if there's a surprise hull breach.
Active sonar now sounds different for each player, depending on their situation, distance, and level of protection. It might sound calm inside the submarine, but I wouldn't recommend stepping outside to get a better listen.
